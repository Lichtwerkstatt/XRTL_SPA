/**
 * Experiment Setup Component
 *
 * @description Within this React component, all experiment components are intialised and the renderings of their windows, if selected, are handled.
 * In addition, important variables are passed to the individual components.
 *
 * @param {Set} selected - Set contains the controlIds of the component windows that are currently opened/rendered
 * 
 * @example 
          {props.selected.has(// general controlId) && ( // handles the renderings of the window, if the variable selected includes the controlId 
          <COMPONENT  
          title= // Title within the topper of the component window
          id={// general controlId of the component}
          controlIdTop={// controlId for the upper stepper motor}
          controlIdBottom={// controlId for the lower stepper motor}
          top={// Positioning at the height of the window}
          left={// Positioning at the width of the window}
        />
        )}
