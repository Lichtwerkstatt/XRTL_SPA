                    The two beams of light are reflected by mirrors placed at a 90-degree angle to each other. This mirror is used to reflect the sample beam. The translation mount is designed to securely
                    hold a mirror in place while offering repeatable linear travel using the precision micrometer actuator, which is graduated in 1 Âµm increments. This component is used to create a
                    quantifiable change in the path length of the sample beam.
