# XRTwinLab Single Page Application
Remote labs are a trendsetting way of teaching, communicating, and experiencing science as well as enabling collaborative work. Unfortunately, the implementation of remote access involves a cost-intensive development or at least requires a certain technical skillset. To establish remote labs across disciplines, especially outside the field of IT and engineering, the technical access threshold must be low enough to support a self-contained implementation by researchers, assistants, and technical staff. Hereby, we are developing the open-source toolbox XR Twin Lab for the research field of Photonics. XR Twin Lab (XRTL) provides a modular way of building a web-based application to control optical experimental setups with the integration of VR and AR endpoints.
